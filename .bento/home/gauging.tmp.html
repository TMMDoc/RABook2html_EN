<p>The currently selected bend is displayed in detail on the right panel, and various settings shown can be edited. To understand the meanings of Gauge <strong>Z1</strong>, Gauge <strong>Z2</strong>, Gauge <strong>R1</strong> and Gauge <strong>R2</strong>, its necessary to understand the coordinate system used by:</p>

<p>The <strong>Z1</strong> and <strong>Z2</strong> axes are the gauge positions along the machine table.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>X</strong> axes are gauge distances from the bend line, with increasing <strong>X</strong> going into the machine.</p>

<li>
<p>The <strong>R</strong> axis is the vertical positions of the gauges, with positive R going upwards.</p>

<p>When the outer height of the flange that needs to be bent is specified, and the gauge position is computed automatically. This computation takes the material, thickness and die opening into account (you can toggle between the two to see the actual Gauge-<strong>X</strong> that has been computed for a given flange height). On machines where the two gauges can move independently in <strong>X</strong>, you can input the values for <strong>X1</strong> and <strong>X2</strong> using the input boxes provided.</p>
