<p>There are many different concepts how a workflow in manufacturing sheet metal parts could be handled, especially if in the field of compensating tolerances of the material to bend accurate parts. This chapter is a collection of information which should help you to understand the different concepts and to find the best solution for your application.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Air Bending: The sheet is not fully pressed into the die, allowing for flexible angle adjustments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bottoming (Coining): The metal is fully pressed into the die for precise angles and sharper bends.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Large radius bending: The part approximates a large radius by several successive small bends</p>
