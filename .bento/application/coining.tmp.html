<p>'Coining' dies and punches are usually used only for 90 degree bends. There are coining dies and punches developed by TAT special tool production having different angles than 90째.
Reason for not being in standard tool catalogue: The resulting angle is dependent on the sheet metal or its quality. Sometimes it can happen that 60 degree die and punch do not deliver a 60 degree angle because of spring back therefore the final result might be a die and punch equipped with 58.0 degrees. Special tool production department is testing that kind of ordered tools for correct bending result.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A 'Coining' punch or die cannot be used for a normal air-bending of 90 degrees (because there is no possiblity to overbend for spring-back correction).  However a 90째 coining die can be used to bend angles larger than 90째+overbending anlge. (Example: thick metal sheets)
The same statement is valid for upper tools.</p>

<p>Since tools are very expensive the customer might use his 90째 coining die for air-bending in combination with his goose neck upper tool (OW200S) to achieve a bendable solution.</p>
