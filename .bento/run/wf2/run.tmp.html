<p>Pressing the <strong>run</strong> button shown in this dialog takes you to the <strong>Run Program</strong> page. This page is similar to the page which comes up while running a model, the only difference being, in place of the 3D views of each step, a table with the step values are displayed. While running a direct program, the <strong>edit cycle</strong> and <strong>corrections</strong> buttons are highlighted whenever there is a change, and there is also a yellow dot displayed near each bend that has been corrected. See the image below - the current bend has some cycle corrections, and bends 1 and 3 have some corrections:</p>
