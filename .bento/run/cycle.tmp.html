<p>This editor displays a time-graph of the bending process. You can set up ram positions (like the slow-down positions), ram speeds (like the bend speed, approach speed) and delays (like the bend delay and the pinch delay) and then press <strong>apply</strong> to apply the changes. The changes made here are also saved with the program and used for the next time. Sometimes on a part, you may want a value to be copied across all the bends, say for example the TDC value. To facilitate this, use <strong>copy</strong>. Pressing this button copies the selected field&#8217;s value across all the bends of the part. A warning message (like Set Slowdown=6mm on all bends?) is displayed before applying the change.</p>
