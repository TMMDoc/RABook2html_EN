<p><strong>Direct programs</strong> are the programs that have been created directly on the control using the Direct Program environment. There are no 3D illustrations available for each step, nor can do any collision checks for these, except machine-against-machine. When a program is picked and open for editing, a screen very similar to the Direct program creation is presented, except that you are now editing a program that was created earlier.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>3D Model</strong> programs are created either by importing from a 3D model, or by folding up a DXF, or using the profile library. These programs have an accompanying 3D model which can be used to set up back-gauges, or to modify the sequence. When these programs are run, step-by-step 3D illustrations are displayed showing the bending steps that are in progress.</p>
